## About:
Welcome to my tribute webpage dedicated to Rabindranath Tagore, a Bengali poet, philosopher, and polymath who reshaped Bengali literature and music in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. I chose to make this tribute webpage on Tagore because I am deeply moved by his poetry and philosophy, which convey a profound understanding of human nature and the human condition. Through this webpage, I hope to share Tagore's message of love, spirituality, and social justice, and inspire others to discover the beauty and depth of his works.

## Features: 
1. A header containing the title of the page, "Tribute Website | Rabindranath Tagore" and a link to an external stylesheet.
2. A container div to hold the entire content of the webpage.
3. A section for the top portion with an image and text, with flexbox for layout.
4. A section titled "The Bard of Bengal" with a quote from Tagore and a brief introduction to his life and work.
5. A section titled "Famous Literary Works" which lists some of Tagore's most well-known works.
6. A footer containing a link to an external source for more information about the poet.
7. The use of semantic HTML tags to structure the content.
8. CSS styling to control the layout and appearance of the webpage including: <br>
   • setting default margin, padding, and box-sizing for all elements on the page <br>
   • setting a maximum width for the content of the page and centering it horizontally <br>
   • styling for the top section including setting margins, image size and shape, and font sizes and colors for the headings <br>
   • styling for the about section including setting margins, font sizes and colors for the headings and paragraphs, and justifying the text <br>
   • styling for the literary works section including setting margins and font sizes and colors for the heading and list items <br>
   • styling for the footer including setting margins and font sizes and aligning the text to the right
